The phone's rear-facing camera is excellent, except its low-light imaging, which is above average in comparison. The phone's performance is generally fast, but the Exynos 9820 throttles under continuous stress. One UI is the best custom Android UI and it offers extensive software features and UI customizability, without overwhelming the user. The phone's charging speed is too slow as per 2019 standards. Still, all things considered, the Galaxy S10 Plus is definitely one of the best smartphones of 2019.","null",""

Apart from the missing headphone jack, thereâ€™s nothing else that I could think of, being particularly bad on the phone. It has an eye-catching design, it feels thinner than it actually is, and it has the best display in the smartphone business, as of 2019. The Exynos 9825 brings speed and smoothness, and One UI is one of the nicest feeling software in the business. All four cameras on the phone are excellent. While the Note 10 Plus canâ€™t quite reach the level and clarity of the P30 Proâ€™s camera in low-light conditions, it more than makes up for it in the video recording capability. The phone has dozens of useful features, including Samsung Pay and water resistance. Battery life is good, too, but not among the best in the business. All-in-all, it is one of the best phones released in 2019.","null",""
